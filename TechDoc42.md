1. Create a new file called `freestyle_app.py` in the code directory:
   - This file will be used to implement the freestyle_app service.

2. Define a function called `display_hello_world` in the `freestyle_app.py` file:
   - This function will be responsible for displaying the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.

3. Import any necessary libraries or modules in the `freestyle_app.py` file:
   - This may include libraries for user interface design or text display.

4. Implement the `display_hello_world` function to display the message "Hello, World!" on the screen:
   - This can be done by using the appropriate functions or methods provided by the chosen development language or framework.

5. Test the `display_hello_world` function to ensure it is working correctly:
   - This can be done by running the freestyle_app service and verifying that the message "Hello, World!" is displayed on the screen.

6. Update the UI design to include a text element that displays the message "Hello, World!":
   - This may involve modifying the user interface code or adding a new component to the UI.

7. Test the updated UI design to ensure the text element is displaying the message "Hello, World!":
   - This can be done by running the freestyle_app service and verifying that the text element displays the correct message.

8. Refactor the code and make any necessary improvements or optimizations:
   - This may involve restructuring the code, improving performance, or adding error handling.

9. Test the final version of the freestyle_app service to ensure it meets the user requirements:
   - This can be done by running the service and verifying that the message "Hello, World!" is displayed on the screen as expected.

10. Document the code and provide any necessary instructions or explanations:
   - This may include adding comments to the code or creating a separate documentation file.

11. Submit the code for review and feedback:
   - This can be done by sharing the code with the relevant stakeholders or team members for review.
